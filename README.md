# contractful frontend

![Vercel](https://vercelbadge.vercel.app/api/[TODO]/[TODO])

The frontend for trustless and decentralized contracting solution.

‚ú® Official demo: <https://contractful.vercel.app/>.

For details on the protocol and user case in general, please visit [the contractful protocol's README](https://github.com/contractful/protocol-v1).

You will also find [additional details on the project on the devpost page about contractful](https://devpost.com/TODO).

## Quick start

* Beta contractful Hiring Agreements run on the Polygon Mumbai testnet and are quoted in fDAI (fake DAI).
    * You can mint fDAI, [using the contract here](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x10055ef62E88eF68b5011F4c7b5Ab9B99f00BB40#writeContract). Note: You might need to add fDAI as a custom token to your Wallet (e.g. MetaMask).
    * You might also need testnet MATIC in order to mint fDAI. You can receive these MATIC [using the faucet for the Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
* As a client:
    * Visit: <https://contractful.vercel.app/>.
    * Choose to create an Agreement.
    * Connect your Wallet.
    * Fill out the details of Hiring Agreement (incl. a description, engagement period and start, as well as the pre-defined hourly rate) and create it.
    * You are now able to review the newly created Hiring Agreement. Your partner is now able to consent to it.
* As a freelancer or service provider:
    * Also, visit: <https://contractful.vercel.app/>.
    * Navigate to review an Agreement and connect your Wallet.
    * Read the Agreement carefully, and choose to consent to it.

üòÉ Enjoy full security and automation while focussing on building awesome web3 tech.

## Local setup

The full protocol of the solution can be interfaced by using the official demo (see above). Anyway, here you will learn, how to use the contractful frontend - to create, deploy and sign a Hiring Agreement - just from you local machine.

To fire up the fronted locally, please use the following instructions:

* Make sure, you have `node` and `npm` installed. The project is tested with:

```
% node --version
v18.7.0

% npm --version
8.15.0
```

* `git clone` this repository.
* `cd` into `frontend-v1`.
* When starting the frontend for the first time, please install all dependencies: `npm i`.
* Use `npx next dev` to start the frontend.
* Finally, visit: [http://localhost:3000/].

### Use IPFS

Specify the key to access the IPFS Gateway API in the `.env` variables.

üëç Well done - you are now able to create, deploy and sign trustless decentralized Hiring Agreements from your local machine.

## Notes for development

### Build and lint

Use the following command to build or lint the frontend application:

```
# Building:
npx next build

# Linting:
npx next lint && npx tsc --noEmit

# Combined in a pre-commit hook:
npm run pre-commit
```

### Boostrapping of the frontend application

Initially, this application was bootstrapped using the following commands (for the UI application skeleton):

```
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript

npm i mui@latest
npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm i @mui/icons-material
npm i @mui/x-date-pickers
npm i dayjs
npm i react-cookie

[...]
```

There are several other libraries involved (e.g. for the integration with the Wallet / blockchain). Please check: [./package.json] for all dependencies.

üòÄ Have fun coding!
