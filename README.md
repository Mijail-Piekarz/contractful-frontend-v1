![Vercel](https://vercelbadge.vercel.app/api/[owner]/[repo])

The frontend for trustless and decentralized contracting solution.

‚ú® Official demo: [https://contractful.vercel.app/].

*Quick start:*

* TODO Have fDAI on the Polygon Mumbai network
* TODO Create
* TODO Consent
* TODO ...

The full protocol of the solution can be interfaced by using the official demo (see above). Anyway, here you will learn, how to use the contractful frontend - to create, deploy and sign a Hiring Agreement - just from you local machine.

For details on the protocol, please visit [https://github.com/contractful/protocol-v1].

## Getting started

To fire up the fronted locally, please use the following instructions:

* Make sure, you have `node` and `npm` installed. The project is tested with:

```
% node --version
v18.7.0

% npm --version
8.15.0
```

* `git clone` this repository.
* `cd` into `frontend-v1`.
* When starting the frontend for the first time, please install all dependencies: `npm i`.
* Use `npx next dev` to start the frontend.
* Finally, visit: [http://localhost:3000/].

### Use IPFS

Specify the key for a IPFS Gateway API.

üëç Well done - you are now able to create, deploy and sign trustless decentralized Hiring Agreements from your local machine.

## Notes for development

### Build and lint

Use the following command to build or lint the frontend application:

```
npx next build
npx next lint && npx tsc --noEmit

# Combined in a pre-commit hook:
npm run pre-commit
```

TODO Using the following VS Code (Version: 1.73.0 (Universal)) formatter for Typescript/React: `vscode.typescript-language-features`.

### Boostrapping of the frontend application

Initially, this application was bootstrapped using the following commands (for the UI application skeleton):

```
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript

npm i mui@latest
npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm i @mui/icons-material
npm i @mui/x-date-pickers
npm i dayjs
npm i react-cookie

[...]
```

There are several other libraries involved (e.g. for the integration with the Wallet / blockchain). Please check: [./package.json] for all dependencies.

üòÄ Have fun coding!
